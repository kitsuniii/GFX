            <pTitle: “Return to Bramble House: Ronin’s Revenge”

Tagline: Last time, a vampire was revealed. This time, a vampire has Wi-Fi and petty trauma.

⸻

CAST OF RETURNING CHAOS:
    •    Ronin – “Lightly turned” vampire. Half-human, half-vampire, fully ridiculous. Has fangs and zero self-control. Thinks being undead makes him deep. It does not.
    •    Dante – Fully ancient vampire. Goth. Cryptic. Has read 3,000 books but still hasn’t figured out Google Maps.
    •    Vienna – Trauma-bonded to logistics. Hates Bramble House. Packed a flamethrower.
    •    Ayomide – Still the only adult. Has anti-vampire spreadsheets now. Wears garlic like it’s fashion.
    •    Isabella – Dating Dante. Calls it “gothic soulmate vibes.” Also possibly possessed? TBD.
    •    Saffron – Convinced Ronin’s transformation is due to Mercury retrograde.
    •    Ezra – Definitely writing a trilogy about this. May be hallucinating. Keeps calling himself “Fangbait.”

⸻

ACT I: A TERRIBLE IDEA

Vienna texts the group chat:

“Do NOT speak to me. Bramble House is BACK on Airbnb. It has 5 stars. WHO LEFT A POSITIVE REVIEW?!”

Ronin replies:

“Me. It was a vibe. Also… I may have left something there.”

Turns out Ronin forgot his “Daylight Ring™”, the one thing keeping him from becoming a crispy vampire croissant in the sun.

He wants to go back and retrieve it.

Everyone: “That’s a YOU problem.”

Ronin: “Fine, then I’ll go ALONE. With Trevor the goat.”

Everyone: …
Ezra: “Fine. I’m coming. For research.”
Dante: “If he gets staked, I’m not cleaning it up.”
Vienna: groan heard in seven dimensions
⸻

ACT II: BACK AT BRAMBLE HOUSE

The house is somehow worse.
    •    The walls bleed if you say “vibe.”
    •    There’s a mirror that shows your biggest insecurity (Saffron saw herself as a dentist).
    •    Trevor the goat now speaks Latin. Unclear if possessed or just dramatic.
    •    Dante gets suspiciously quiet. Like, “plotting a betrayal” quiet.

Ronin finds his ring… BUT it’s fused into the floor. Glowing red. Pulsing. Whispering.

“Uhh guys? My ring is… sentient now.”

Ayomide immediately grabs her emergency holy water (labeled: “Absolutely Not Juice”).

Too late.

The ring bonds with Ronin’s hand. His eyes go full vampire.
He starts levitating. Very slowly. Like a possessed Roomba.

Ezra: “Oh my God. He’s evolving.”
Vienna: “He’s glitching. Someone unplug him.”
Isabella: “Honestly… slay.”

Ronin gets dramatic and yells:

“I AM THE NIGHT! I AM THE WRATH! I AM… still a little hungry, is there any cereal?”
⸻

ACT III: VAMPIRE WAR

Turns out… Dante knew the ring was cursed.
He left it behind on purpose. It’s a test — an ancient trial to see if Ronin can handle true vampire power.

Ayomide: “YOU SET HIM UP?!”
Dante: “Look. He kept calling himself ‘Vamp Daddy’ in the group chat. He needed humility.”

Now, the house itself awakens. Doors lock. Shadows crawl. Ronin starts floating faster.

“You abandoned me, Dante. I was your bro… and now I’m your FANGSOME ENEMY!”

Ezra: clapping “Yes! Script that. Perfect monologue.”
Vienna: “WE ARE IN A CURSED HOUSE WITH TWO UNSTABLE VAMPIRES AND A TALKING GOAT—”
Saffron: “Trevor says he’s Team Ronin.”

Suddenly, the walls crack open. Bramble House reveals its final form: a living entity that feeds on drama.

Which means… they’re all doomed.

Unless…
⸻

ACT IV: CHAOTIC SOLUTION

Ayomide throws holy water. Saffron chants affirmations. Isabella dramatically breaks up with Dante for the narrative tension.
Ezra plays emotional violin music to distract the house.
Vienna throws the itinerary into the fireplace and screams, “IF I DIE HERE I’M TAKING YOU ALL WITH ME.”

Ronin starts glitching again.

Dante steps forward.

“I’m sorry, Ronin. I should’ve trained you better. I was afraid… of friendship.”

Everyone: 🧍‍♀️

They hug. It’s awkward. Then lightning strikes them both and resets the curse. Classic.

⸻

EPILOGUE: NEVER AGAIN
    •    Ronin is fine. Slightly less dramatic. Still deeply untrustworthy.
    •    Dante and Isabella are back together. She’s now legally considered “undead-adjacent.”
    •    Ezra publishes a bestselling vampire-romance called “Bleed Me Gently.”
    •    Vienna blocks Airbnb. Permanently.
    •    Ayomide now leads group therapy. For everyone.
    •    Saffron runs a crystal shop called “Bite Me Energy.”

Trevor the goat?
Now a cult leader. Fluent in 3 ancient languages.
We don’t ask.
