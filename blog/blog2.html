                <h1>Post of 6-9-25!</h1>
            <p> Im backkkk!! ... just to copy and paste a fan fic Saffron wrote for us. I think it was written with Chat GPT, but i don't really care, it was entertaining. <br>ahem... and i present to you...<br></p>
            <p>Return to Bramble House: Ronin’s Revenge”
<br><br>
Tagline: Last time, a vampire was revealed. This time, a vampire has Wi-Fi and petty trauma.
<br><br>
⸻
<br><br>
CAST OF RETURNING CHAOS:<br>
    •    Ronin – “Lightly turned” vampire. Half-human, half-vampire, fully ridiculous. Has fangs and zero self-control. Thinks being undead makes him deep. It does not.<br>
    •    Dante – Fully ancient vampire. Goth. Cryptic. Has read 3,000 books but still hasn’t figured out Google Maps.<br>
    •    Vienna – Trauma-bonded to logistics. Hates Bramble House. Packed a flamethrower.<br>
    •    Ayomide – Still the only adult. Has anti-vampire spreadsheets now. Wears garlic like it’s fashion.<br>
    •    Isabella – Dating Dante. Calls it “gothic soulmate vibes.” Also possibly possessed? TBD.<br>
    •    Saffron – Convinced Ronin’s transformation is due to Mercury retrograde.<br>
    •    Ezra – Definitely writing a trilogy about this. May be hallucinating. Keeps calling himself “Fangbait.”
<br><br>
⸻
<br><br>
ACT I: A TERRIBLE IDEA
<br><br>
Vienna texts the group chat:
<br><br>
“Do NOT speak to me. Bramble House is BACK on Airbnb. It has 5 stars. WHO LEFT A POSITIVE REVIEW?!”
<br><br>
Ronin replies:
<br><br>
“Me. It was a vibe. Also… I may have left something there.”
<br><br>
Turns out Ronin forgot his “Daylight Ring™”, the one thing keeping him from becoming a crispy vampire croissant in the sun.
<br><br>
He wants to go back and retrieve it.
<br><br>
Everyone: “That’s a YOU problem.”
<br><br>
Ronin: “Fine, then I’ll go ALONE. With Trevor the goat.”
<br><br>
Everyone: …<br>
Ezra: “Fine. I’m coming. For research.”<br>
Dante: “If he gets staked, I’m not cleaning it up.”<br>
Vienna: groan heard in seven dimensions<br>
⸻<br><br>

ACT II: BACK AT BRAMBLE HOUSE
<br><br>
The house is somehow worse.<br>
    •    The walls bleed if you say “vibe.”<br>
    •    There’s a mirror that shows your biggest insecurity (Saffron saw herself as a dentist).<br>
    •    Trevor the goat now speaks Latin. Unclear if possessed or just dramatic.<br>
    •    Dante gets suspiciously quiet. Like, “plotting a betrayal” quiet.<br>
<br><br>
Ronin finds his ring… BUT it’s fused into the floor. Glowing red. Pulsing. Whispering.<br>
<br>
“ guys? My ring is… sentient now.”
<br><br>
Ayomide immediately grabs her emergency holy water (labeled: “Absolutely Not Juice”).
<br><br>
Too late.
<br><br>
The ring bonds with Ronin’s hand. His eyes go full vampire.<br>
He starts levitating. Very slowly. Like a possessed Roomba.<br>
<br>
Ezra: “Oh my God. He’s evolving.”<br>
Vienna: “He’s glitching. Someone unplug him.”<br>
Isabella: “Honestly… slay.”<br>
<br>
Ronin gets dramatic and yells:<br>
<br>
“I AM THE NIGHT! I AM THE WRATH! I AM… still a little hungry, is there any cereal?”<br>
⸻<br>
<br>
ACT III: VAMPIRE WAR<br>
<br>
Turns out… Dante knew the ring was cursed.<br>
He left it behind on purpose. It’s a test — an ancient trial to see if Ronin can handle true vampire power.<br>
<br>
Ayomide: “YOU SET HIM UP?!”<br>
Dante: “Look. He kept calling himself ‘Vamp Daddy’ in the group chat. He needed humility.”<br>
<br>
Now, the house itself awakens. Doors lock. Shadows crawl. Ronin starts floating faster.<br>
<br>
“You abandoned me, Dante. I was your bro… and now I’m your FANGSOME ENEMY!”<br>
<br>
Ezra: clapping, “Yes! Script that. Perfect monologue.”<br>
Vienna: “WE ARE IN A CURSED HOUSE WITH TWO UNSTABLE VAMPIRES AND A TALKING GOAT—”<br>
Saffron: “Trevor says he’s Team Ronin.”<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the walls crack open. Bramble House reveals its final form: a living entity that feeds on drama.<br>
<br>
Which means… they’re all doomed.<br>
<br>
Unless…<br>
⸻<br>
<br>
ACT IV: CHAOTIC SOLUTION<br>
<br>
Ayomide throws holy water. Saffron chants affirmations. Isabella dramatically breaks up with Dante for the narrative tension.<br>
Ezra plays emotional violin music to distract the house.<br>
Vienna throws the itinerary into the fireplace and screams, “IF I DIE HERE I’M TAKING YOU ALL WITH ME.”<br>
<br>
Ronin starts glitching again.<br>
<br>
Dante steps forward.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry, Ronin. I should’ve trained you better. I was afraid… of friendship.”<br>
<br>
Everyone: 🧍‍♀️<br>
<br>
They hug. It’s awkward. Then lightning strikes them both and resets the curse. Classic.<br>
<br>
⸻<br>
<br>
EPILOGUE: NEVER AGAIN<br>
    •    Ronin is fine. Slightly less dramatic. Still deeply untrustworthy.<br>
    •    Dante and Isabella are back together. She’s now legally considered “undead-adjacent.”<br>
    •    Ezra publishes a bestselling vampire-romance called “Bleed Me Gently.”<br>
    •    Vienna blocks Airbnb. Permanently.<br>
    •    Ayomide now leads group therapy. For everyone.<br>
    •    Saffron runs a crystal shop called “Bite Me Energy.”<br>
<br>
Trevor the goat?<br>
Now a cult leader. Fluent in 3 ancient languages.<br>
We don’t ask.<br>
<br><br>
⸻
<br>
Group Chat Name changed to:<br>
🧛‍♂️ “Never Bramble Again (Unless We’re Hot)” 🔥</p>
            <p><br>... i don't know Saffron's problem, but she obviously isnt sane. At all. I dont feel like writing anymore, so uhmmm... see ya!</p>
