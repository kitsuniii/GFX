                <h3>Life status!</h3>
            <p>I'm gonna move this page to /gfx for now, and might actually keep it at this address! I'm going to transfer this blog 'page' to another page as this page just looks unorganised. I'm going to do this later as i'm kinda in class right now, but it's happening!</p>
            <p>New info about the site.
Welcome to the blog page, or whatever the hell this classifies as ...üò≠ Since I am WAY too lazy to remake the blog page, I guess i'm just keeping it here for now. Not like it really matters, this site is being migrated anyways... :p

Anywhatsit, this page is changing drastically, and i'm starting to like coding this site again! Sorry for not updating the original site since LAST YEAR, i have been working on stuff for this and also got busy with schoolwork.

speaking of school...</p>
            <p>Life is honestly going good, besides the fact that i lost my 3ds at school!! There were SOOO many photos on that thing i wanted to back up to my computer, but I just had to lose it!!<br>...anyways, i have recently modded my Fire Max 11(IM NOT POOR I SWEAR) and went through my tech cabinet. I was actually able to find some cool stuff, like the first ipod, first iphone in HORRID condition, a music player from the 2000s (i actually use it on a daily basis now), and a GAME BOY ADVANCED. AND IT WORKS. LIKE, FULLY FUNCTIONAL! There is batteries in it, so i just powered it on and it seems to work perfectly fine. The sound quality is DIABOLICAL, though... I also found a first gen fire stick that works on the chromebooks (with a power bank cuz it draws so much power). I also found a nintendo 64 on the shelf in my parents office! It looks like it works, but I can't find the hdmi cord because it is from last century, so we will never know.<br><br> Enough about tech though, let's talk about school gossip!! So, there is this ANNOYING kid that kept sitting at our table. We took a vote to ask him to leave, and he did, only to show up again not a week later. We kindly showed him to another table, but he wouldn't go there. We took another vote to kick him out, he wouldn't leave. We didn't respond and started being rude to him (we were returning the favor), and he still wouldn't take the hint.<br> This went on for about a month until we all decided to leave the table as he started screaming and getting us in trouble. We moved across the cafiteria to a table with nobody there. THIS KID FOLLOWED US THERE AT THE END OF LUNCH AND SHOWED UP AND STARTED ACTING ALL NICE ABOUT US MOVING...üò≠ He started asking dumb questions like "WhY dId YalL lEaVe mE To RoT bY mmYseLF?üòç", and "WhAt ArE YoUu GuYs dOiNg HerEE?". Like, I'm sorry, did you not take the hint? You couldn't have moved to another table with people or stayed at that table? come on... The next day, we all sit down trying to figure a way to get him away before he sits down. We decide to take up as much room as possible, and that STILL didn't work! HE MOVED ME OUT OF THE WAY TO SIT IN MY SPOT AND ACTED LIKE HE WAS THE VICTIM WHEN A KID AT OUR TABLE CRASHED OUT ON HIM! He kept telling him to "lower your voice", and that only pissed them off EVEN MORE. We moved again, and he followed us there! We moved back to the other table, and it seemed like he took the hint as he left.<br> He sat at another table for a while, until he started sitting with us AGAIN. The kid that crashed out previously (lets call him vani) starts to yell at him to leave every day. About a week passes and this is still going on. He sits at our table, per the normal (i guess). Vani is pissed as usual, but this time he seemed more pissed than usual. I think its because the person is using their dog that is being put down as an excuse to sit with us? Not sure, but seems like it from what i picked up. Vani did the usual crash out, but more fumed than usual. This finally got him to leave our table!<br> Fast forward to today, and he hasn't seemed to try to sit with us. The only we have heard of him is when he screams in the hallway for no apparent reason... üôÑ Seems dealt with though. I did leave out that we did tell the teachers, but they said they sadly couldn't do anything about it at the state it is at currently (understandable). Glad it was dealt with!! <br><br>anyways, I typed WAY too much for today, and need to take my daily workout. See ya!! </p>
